# Foodbank-Volunteers

The name of our project is Foodbank volunteers


This is our description of our Project

The category of our challenge is The Rise of No-code/Low-code, with the following Challenge Statement: “In partnership with our Community Partner The Food Bank Singapore, we challenge you to formulate a ‘Volunteer-to-Task’ management system that is all-encompassing and streamlines the allocation of volunteers to tasks or activities.” 

The different problems voiced by Foodmember staff members themselves, and our solutions to their predicament are as follows: 

Volunteers Not Getting Notified About Volunteer Opportunities
Not only are there numerous activities for any volunteer to sign up for, but there are also activities which demand consistency and urgency. One example is the role of a Delivery Driver/Assistant, a daily shift where volunteers need to assist with both collection and deliveries of food donations. As such, it is critical that a volunteer is found as soon as possible to fill such roles. 

Our solution to that headache is an email notification system. When an administrator learns of alarming vacancies to a role, they may decide to send an email to all users, notifying them about this particular upcoming (and under-staffed) event,  all at the push of a button. This email is a templated email, sent to all users who have indicated interest in receiving email notifications. 

With this email functionality, we address any possible lack of awareness surrounding an activity amongst volunteers, especially new volunteers who lack a shared network with senior volunteers and staff. Furthermore, the email notification system reduces the workload of the administrators themselves, and could open up the administrative role to new volunteers as well, who might face difficulty contacting other volunteers. 

“Volunteer mismatch ratio”
FoodBank members described a problem of a “volunteer mismatch ratio”, which we interpret as a problem of the same small group of familiar faces volunteering for events that the wider community of volunteers are unaware of. Hence, in complement to our email notification system which addresses an awareness issue, we have devised a user system to categorise volunteers, allowing a more accessible and convenient platform to pair individual volunteers to unique activities. 

Through this user system, a logging of the number of hours each volunteer has contributed can be accessed by both the user and the administrator. As such, the administrator could prioritise different members for different activities, especially if a volunteer might be approaching a burn-out from urgent roles, and a fresh volunteer would be a better fit. 

Any member who is consistent in volunteering could also sign up as a “Regular Volunteer” under our user system. This categorisation transforms the method in which volunteers and administrators interact when faced with a vacant role. Commonly, it is the user who signs up for an event. With the categorisation of a “Regular Volunteer”, an administrator can allocate roles and duties to the volunteers themselves, minimising headaches surrounding roles which require consistency. 

Furthermore, we have constructed a recommendation system to maximise suitability of a volunteer for a particular event. This recommendation system takes into account preferences for a category of activity (eg. adventurous), as well as the locality of a volunteer’s residence. We believe accounting for a volunteer’s interests and travelling distance reduces the barrier of entry for any volunteer when considering what event to register under. 

Our user system also streamlines the process of what application requires processing, and what does not. This is facilitated by the demarcation of Regular and Single events. Single events are ad-hoc or one-time duties as described on the Foodbank website, while Regular events are events which require consistency (eg. daily or weekly attendance). An individual volunteer signing up for a Single event does not require processing by the administrator under our system; what is processed by the administrator are group sign-ups and applications for Regular events. Doing so minimises the backlog of processed applications, and provides clarity to an administrator’s role. 

For the administrator, one may also directly create categories to allow events to be more identifiable by users. Not only that, they can choose to add a Featured category to unique ad-hoc large-scale events which require a large number of volunteers. 

We believe these various functionalities, spearheaded by our user system, maximises coordination between event vacancies and volunteers, as well as minimising any demand for micro-management from the administrators. 

Other Initiatives
Other initiatives include our construction of a single-page website, which minimises lag and data-loading time when navigating to different pages. This website is also mobile-responsive, with components rearranged according to different screen-resolutions, increasing accessibility of the user system by both volunteers and administrators. 

This project was made possible by the Bubble platform, a low-code tool which allows users to visually configure web elements, as well as backend databases. We believe that beyond the use of a low-code platform to register for a hackathon, using a low-code platform also increases maintainability through the implementation of Bubble.io’s graphical ui. Hopefully, the usage of Bubble.io’s low-code platform reduces any headaches when (and should) we handover this application to Foodbank. Bubble.io also provides scalability, with a flexible database that can adapt to a large database with potentially thousands of users registered under our project’s user system. 

With the rise of the No Code/Low-Code, our team hopes that we can help create an accessible digital platform for both volunteers and Foodbank Singapore, and provide a modest contribution to the social service sector.
